## 📌 Description

This repository contains a **console version of the classic game Connect Four**.  
It was developed as an **academic project in 2022** at the National University of Colombia, and later extended to strengthen programming skills.  

It includes not only Python programming fundamentals, but also more advanced features such as:

- ✅ **Robust input validation** for numbers and strings.  
- ✅ **Complete game flow control**: turns, restarts, tie detection.  
- ✅ **Scoreboard management** using `pandas.DataFrame` to keep player statistics.  
- ✅ Use of the standard library `random` to introduce variations into the game.  

📚 **Author:** Juan Pablo Marín Montoya

## 🗂️ Repository Organization
The project is organized in a single Python script that manages:

- 📋 **Main menu** with options for gameplay, scores, and exit.  
- 🎲 **Game logic** with a dynamic console-based board.  
- 🏆 **Scoreboard** with records of wins and losses.

## 🏆 Example Scoreboard
After several matches, player statistics are stored in a **DataFrame**:  

```python
    Player   Wins   Losses
0   Juan     2      1
1   Maria    1      2
